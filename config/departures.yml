  #  Get result by GTFS stop_id. Can be used to retrive individual stops and to separate departures of Prague and
  #  intercity routes, even if they depart from the same physical stop. A list of GTFS stops can be found in stops.txt
  #  file of the GTFS feed

  ids: [ 'U1935Z1P', 'U1935Z1' ]
  # Set the start of interval from which to retrieve departures. Positive numbers are set in past relative to the time
  # of request or timeFrom timestamp, negative numbers set the start in the future. Use to compensate for walking
  # distance to a stop. Default is set to 0. Maximum value is 30 because of implemented data retention.
  minutes_before: 0
  # Set the end of interval from which to retrieve departures. Positive numbers are set in future relative to the time
  # of request or timeFrom timestamp, negative are in the past. The sum of minutesBefore and minutesAfter must be larger
  # than zero. Default is set to 180.

  # When selecting a node by name, when true, will include metro and/or train stops that are a member of the same node.
  # I.e. when querying Na Knížecí, setting this to true will add the metro station Anděl to results as well because
  # both have the same ASW node number 1040.

  # Enrich departures with vehicle air condition information. Setting to false will force all items to be null. Useful
  # for disabling the indication of air condition during cold season.

  # Preferred timezone offset as defined in the IANA Time zone database in the form of Country/City (use an URL encoded

  # Valid entries: departures (default), arrivals, mixed. Set how to handle behaviour in end stops. departures
  # (default) returns all connections that depart from selected stops (does not return connections for which it is the
  # final stop). arrivals returns all connections that arrive into the stops (does not return connections for which it
  # is the first stop). mixed returns everything. Use arrivals to create dedicated arrival boards. Use departures for
  # all other cases. Using mixed is not recomended as departures of adjoined routes will be returned twice.

  # Valid entries: real (default), timetable. Order results by predicted time including trip delay or by timetable time
  order: 'real'

  # Valid entries: canceled, atStop, untracked. Skips trips with these attributes. Use multiple rules with
  # &skip[]=cancelled&skip[]=atStop query parameter array form.
